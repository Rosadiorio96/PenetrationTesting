"""
When run as a CGI, PHP up to version 5.3.12 and 5.4.2 is 
vulnerable to an argument injection vulnerability. 
This module takes advantage of the -d flag to set php.ini 
directives to achieve code execution. From the advisory: 
"if there is NO unescaped '=' in the query string, the string 
is split on '+' (encoded space) characters, urldecoded, passed 
to a function that escapes shell metacharacters (the "encoded in 
a system-defined manner" from the RFC) and then passes them to 
the CGI binary." This module can also be used to exploit the 
plesk 0day disclosed by kingcope and exploited in the wild 
on June 2013.
